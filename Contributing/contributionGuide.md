## Who can Contribute

Everyone! Priveasy is open to all kinds of contributions from all kinds of people. Although most people contribute code, or open issues, we accept all kinds of help. For example, we're also open to accepting help from lawyers, artists, social media influencers, small printshops and other businesses, etc.

## How to Contribute

1. Look to see if your contribution is redundant, before opening a new pull request or issue. Search through open pull requests and issues, and make sure that your contribution is original, or you have something new to add. If you do find out that your contribution—or a similar contribution—is already under way, join the discussion! We always love new perspectives and ideas, and the more help we can get, the better!
2. If you find that you have something to add, [sign our CLA](#contributor-license-agreement "sign our CLA").
3. Determine whether to open an issue or a pull request. If you can easily identify the issue, know how to fix it, and are able to fix it, then a pull request is probably your best bet. However, we still recommend opening an issue first to discuss what you would like to fix/add, because it's very likely that internal development is already under way on that issue/feature. Also, if it's a simple or relatively small contribution, we would rather you let us know about it, so that we can fix it, as our internal team can fast track the fix and bypass all of the extra, time consuming code reviews required for external contributions. If your contribution isn't something that can formatted into a pull request or issue, then please contact us directly, using the email attached to our GitHub profile.
4. Open the issue or make the pull request! We always love contributions, and are more than happy to work with you!
5. Anyone who makes significant contributions has the opportunity to be featured on our supporters page, should they wish.

## What to Contribute

##### Here are some ideas for ways in which you may be able to contribute:

- Did you notice a bug or have an issue while using any of Priveasy's services? Open an issue and let us know!
- Did you find a security flaw, or know of a way in which our security could be improved? If the flaw/recommendation is minor, open an issue! If it's more serious, send us an email! You may be entitled to a bug bounty reward!
- Do you have an idea for a new feature or major change that could help improve Priveasy (make it prettier, more efficient, more secure, etc.)? Make a pull request! We'd love to see it!
- Do you run a small (or large) business that would like to donate some of its resources towards helping us (i.e. print Priveasy stickers and donate to us all of the profits, offer server space or other free resources, etc.)? Thank you! Email us!
- Are you a lawyer or do you know a lawyer that would be willing to help us pro bono in the event of a legal dispute? Wonderful! Email us!
- Anything else? Don't hesitate to reach out, using whatever means work best for you!

##### Outstanding Contribution Requests:

This list includes up-to-date contribution requests: things that we currently need help with.

- We're looking for mobile application developers who are able to work together to create a secure, stable, and fully functional mobile Priveasy application. We need developers both for iOS and Android. If you are able to help, please contact us, and we will provide you with more information.
- We're looking for lawyers who are willing to work pro bono, and be "on call," in the event of a legal dispute.

###### The Contributor License Agreement:

```
Priveasy Individual Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement")

Derived from the Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement V2.0

Thank you for your interest in Priveasy (the "Organization"). In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, the Organization must have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of the Organization and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose. If you have not already done so, please complete and sign the Agreement, should you wish to contribute. Please read this document carefully before signing and keep a copy for your records.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to the Organization. Except for the license granted herein to the Organization and recipients of software distributed by the Organization, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

1. Definitions.
  "You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity
  authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement
  with the Organization. For legal entities, the entity making a
  Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled
  by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to
  be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition,
  "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
  direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
  otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
  outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity. 

  "Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship,
  including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that
  is intentionally submitted by You to the Organization for inclusion
  in, or documentation of, any of the products, services, or programs
  owned or managed by the Organization (the "Work"). For the purposes of
  this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or
  written communication sent to the Organization or its representatives,
  including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing
  lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that
  are managed by, or on behalf of, the Organization for the purpose of
  discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that
  is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You
  as "Not a Contribution."

  "Software Distributed" shall mean any Contribution which has been
  made publicly available by the Organization. This definition includes,
  but is not limited to, any Contribution with which a user may interact,
  over a network.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Organization and to
recipients of Software Distributed by the Organization a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your
Contributions and such derivative works.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Organization and to
recipients of Software Distributed by the Organization a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the
Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims
licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any
entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed,
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for
that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

4. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above
license. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property
that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent
that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf
of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for
your Contributions to the Organization, or that your employer has
executed a separate Corporate CLA with the Organization.

5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original
creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others). You
represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete
details of any third-party license or other restriction (including,
but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you
are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your
Contributions.

6. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions,
except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide
support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by
applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your
Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without
limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-
INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

7. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation,
You may submit it to the Organization separately from any
Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of
any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to,
related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you
are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as
"Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".

8. You agree to notify the Organization of any facts or circumstances of
which you become aware that would make these representations
inaccurate in any respect.

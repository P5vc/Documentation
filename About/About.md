## Overview
Priveasy is the world's first (and only) Internet Privacy Services Provider (IPSP) that is both community-driven, and 100% open source. Our entire codebase is available online for anyone to inspect, improve upon, criticize, or contribute-to, making us the only truly, end-to-end transparent IPSP.

Priveasy is not an company, nor a non-profit. We are simply a collaborative: a growing community of dedicated developers who have come together to build something special, something from which everyone can benefit. While Priveasy does have an organizational structure, it is based solely on contributions, and allows anyone to rise or fall as time goes on, based on the level of commitment they are able to sustain.

Anyone is welcome to use Priveasy's services. Our goal is to guard everyone's rights to privacy and free speech at all times, no matter your place of origin, economic status, gender, race, sexual orientation, technical knowledge, etc. We are built by everyone to serve everyone.

Although it is true that Priveasy charges its users for plans, we do not take any profit. All of our expenditures are meticulously documented, and 100% of the money goes right back into providing our services. That is why we are able to provide our services at such low costs: we have almost no overhead, no greedy executives, and many, wonderful supporters and contributors.

At no point will you find any trackers, cookies, analytics, etc. on our website or embedded in our services. Priveasy takes your privacy seriously, and will go to great lengths to protect it. Don't believe us? Continue reading! You have access to our entire codebase right here at your fingertips. You will never find a single piece of code running on our servers that is not open source, and readily available for you to inspect.

Priveasy is not an company, nor a non-profit. We are simply a collaborative: a growing community of dedicated developers who have come together to build something special, something from which everyone can benefit.

Although it is true that Priveasy charges its users for plans, we do not take any profit. All of our expenditures are meticulously documented, and 100% of the money goes right back into providing our services. That is why we are able to provide our services at such low costs: we have almost no overhead, no greedy executives, and many, wonderful supporters and contributors.

## History
### Priveasy v0.0
Although Priveasy may not have gotten a website or even its name until May of 2019, it was in the works long beforehand. Years before its official creation, Priveasy's founder—Noah—had dedicated his life to internet privacy and security. He was active in the open source community, contributing to many projects, and creating many more of his own. But, it wasn't until he entered high school that Priveasy really started to take shape. Concerned with the extensive levels of logging/tracking/blocking being done by the school system, the town's ISP, and even the federal government, Noah made it his goal to create a solution. Before long, he stumbled across [Algo VPN](https://github.com/trailofbits/algo "Algo VPN"), and used it to set up a simple VPN server for he and his classmates to use. A short while later, there was a long list of users, whom he charged $0.30 each per month, to help cover the server costs.

Although Noah was happy with the VPN server, it still wasn't enough for him, and his "client" list was only growing. It was around this time that he began researching and drafting other important privacy tools to implement, as well as a way to make those services scaleable, and automated. And that, is how Priveasy was born.

## Overview

Priveasy is the world's first (and only) Internet Privacy Services Provider (IPSP) that is both community-driven, and 100% open source. Our entire codebase is available online for anyone to inspect, improve upon, criticize, or contribute-to, making us the only truly, end-to-end transparent IPSP.

Priveasy is not an company, nor a non-profit. We are simply a collaborative: a growing community of dedicated developers who have come together to build something special, something from which everyone can benefit. While Priveasy does have an organizational structure, it is based solely on contributions, and allows anyone to rise or fall as time goes on, based on the level of commitment they are able to sustain.

Anyone is welcome to use Priveasy's services. Our goal is to guard everyone's rights to privacy and free speech at all times, no matter your place of origin, economic status, gender, race, sexual orientation, technical knowledge, etc. We are built by everyone to serve everyone.

Although it is true that Priveasy charges its users for plans, we do not take any profit. All of our expenditures are meticulously documented, and 100% of the money goes right back into providing our services. That is why we are able to provide our services at such low costs: we have almost no overhead, no greedy executives, and many, wonderful supporters and contributors.

At no point will you find any trackers, cookies, analytics, etc. on our website or embedded in our services. Priveasy takes your privacy seriously, and will go to great lengths to protect it. Don't believe us? Continue reading! You have access to our entire codebase right here at your fingertips. You will never find a single piece of code running on our servers that is not open source, and readily available for you to inspect.

## History

### Priveasy v0.0

Although Priveasy may not have gotten a website or even its name until May of 2019, it was in the works long beforehand. Years before its official creation, Priveasy's founder—Noah—had dedicated his life to internet privacy and security. He was active in the open source community, contributing to many projects, and creating many more of his own. But, it wasn't until he entered high school that Priveasy really started to take shape. Concerned with the extensive levels of logging/tracking/blocking being done by the school system, the town's ISP, and even the federal government, Noah made it his goal to create a solution. Before long, he stumbled across [Algo VPN](https://github.com/trailofbits/algo "Algo VPN"), and used it to set up a simple VPN server for he and his classmates to use. A short while later, there was a long list of users, whom he charged $0.30 each per month, to help cover the server costs.

Although Noah was happy with the VPN server, it still wasn't enough for him, and his "client" list was only growing. It was around this time that he began researching and drafting other important privacy tools to implement, as well as a way to make those services scalable, and automated. And that, is how Priveasy was born.

### Priveasy v1.0

Many events and lots of work lead up to the formation of Priveasy.org, but I think it's safe to say that the creation of the actual website itself didn't begin until May of 2019, with the official domain name being registered on June 8, 2019.

This first version of the website was extremely simple, to say the least. Most of the work went into the backend, and it took months to develop. The original site consisted of only three services: a VPN, a burner email forwarder/sender, and a pastebin. The VPN was still run with [Algo VPN](https://github.com/trailofbits/algo "Algo VPN") (just automated), the email services were achieved with a simple [postfix](https://github.com/vdukhovni/postfix "postfix") setup, and the pastebin saved pastes by dumping them all into a single database entry. The website itself used basic bootstrap templates, and was nothing flashy. Overall, the site was slow (updating public pastes, email forwarders, etc. only once every 3 hours, and creating VPN profiles only once every 24 hours). But, despite its downfalls, the site served its purpose, and provided an excellent base to build upon.
